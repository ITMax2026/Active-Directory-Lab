1. Prerequisites for installing new Active Directory Forest:
  1 Set static IP Address
    - Run ipconfig to get VM configurations and note your IPv4 Address, Subnet Mask, and Default Gateway.  (You will use these to fill out following section)
    - Go to Control Panel > Network & Internet > Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings > Right click adapter > Properties > Click IPv4 and select Properties
    - Click Use the following IP adddres:
      - IP address: 192.168.242.10 - you can set as your desired static IP
      - Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
      - Default gateway: 192.168.242.2 - Make sure this matches the gateway found in the ipconfig check earlier 
    - Click Use the following DNS server addresses: 
      - Preferred DNS server: 192.168.242.10 (points the server to itself for DNS)
  - Name the server:
    - Go to System > About > Rename this PC
      - Set it to DC01

2. Install Active Directory
  - Open Server Manager
  - Click Manage and click Add Roles and Features
  - Click Role-based installation
  - Select Active Directory Domain Services > click Add Features

3. Promote Server to Domain Controller
  - In Server Mananger click the yellow flag > click Promote this server to domain controller
  - Deployment configuration:
    - Add a new forest
    - Root domain name: ad.lab
  - Domain controller options:
    - Windows Server 2016
    - Check: Domain Name System (DNS) server and Global Catalog
    - Set a Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) password
  - DNS Options: You can safely ignore the warning "A delegation for this DNS server cannot be created." This is normal for a new root domain.
  - NetBIOS domain name:  should autopopulate and you can leave as default.  In my case AD
  - Click through and install

4. Post Promotion Checks
  - Your log in name should have changed to your domain account.  In my case AD/Administrator
  - Verify DNS
    - Server Manager > Tools > DNS
    - There should be two Forward Lookup Zones: one for _msdcs.ad.lab and one for ad.lab
    - For further validation run dcdiag in powershell and look for mostly "passed test" and warnings.  You don't want errors
