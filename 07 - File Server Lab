Goal: Create a drive (S:) on the domain controller that other users can access
Security Model:
  - Share Permissions: Authenticated Users = Full Control 
    - It is too cumbersome to manage security at two levels.  So at the Share level we provide minimal screening and let NTFS handle security inside
  - NTFS Permission: Hardened security where Principle of Least Privilege applies
  - Access-Based Enumeration (ABE):  If a user doesn't have folder permission, the folder is hidden
