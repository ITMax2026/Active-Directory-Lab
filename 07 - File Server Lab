Goal: Create a drive (S:) on the domain controller that other users can access
Security Model:
  - Share Permissions: Authenticated Users = Full Control 
    - It is too cumbersome to manage security at two levels.  So at the Share level we provide minimal screening and let NTFS handle security inside
  - NTFS Permission: Hardened security where Principle of Least Privilege applies
  - Access-Based Enumeration (ABE):  If a user doesn't have folder permission, the folder is hidden

Part 1: Verify Identity/Setup (Optional
  1. Open ADUC (Active Directory Users and Computers)
  2. Check John HR:
    - Democorp > General_Staff (OU)
    - Open John HR > Member Of tab > Verify G_HR_Staff
  3. Check Jeff Admin:
    - Democorp > Admin_Department (OU)
    - Open Jeff Admin > Member Of tab > Verify G_IT_Admins

Part 2: Create Shared Folders
  1. Log into DC01
  2. Open File Explorer and navigate to C:\
  3. Create a new Folder:  Name it CorpData
  4. Inside CorpData > Create two subfolders:
    - HR_Data
    - IT_Data

Part 3: Open Share, Closed NTFS
  Step 1: Open Share
    1. Right click C:\CorpData > Properties > Sharing > Advanced Sharing
    2. Check Share this folder
    3. Share Name: CorpData
    4. Click Permissions Button
      - Remove Everyone
      - Add Authenticated Users
      - Check Full Control 
        * This lets anyone connected to the network access the Share.  We are going to let NTFS handle file/folder level security

  Step 2: NTFS Root Lock
    1. Right click C:CorpData > Properties > Security > Advanced
    2. Disable Inheritence > "Convert inherited permissions itno explicit permissions"
      * Subfolders keep same permissions they have right now, but will have independent permissions the parent folder going forward
    3. Permission Clean Up
      - Keep SYSTEM and Administrators (Full Control)
      - Remove Users (local)
    4. Access Permission (for Everyone)
      - Click Add > Select a principle > Domain Users
        - Type: Allow
        - Applies to: This folder only
        - Basic Permissions: Read & Execute, List folder contents, Read
      - Click OK
      - 
    *Root Lock keeps S:\  clean and limits future permission mistakes


  Step 3: Closed NTFS
